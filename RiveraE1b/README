Homework Assignment #1 CS-460
  This program takes is ran through the command-line/terminal using g++.
  To run the program it also requires the name of the input file as a parameter

          g++ -o RiveraE1b RiveraE1b.cpp 
          ./RiveraE1b Input.txt          

What issues do you encounter as you wrote this program?

The issue I faced when I first wrote my program was precision error. I would try to convert 
the input into cents rather than bills and cents. But the decimal would be off sometimes when
I would factor it by 100


What strategies did you use to solve the problem?

Luckly I have already encountered this problem before and I quickly realized I forgot to include the round function from the "cmath" library. 

How did you test your program?

I tested this program with various inputs. I tested inputs that would only include bills, inputs with only coins,
as well as big and small transactions. Tried to break it.
